# Stack Underflow
Team: Matt Faliszek, Peter Hinners, Emmanuel Obi, Jason Pettus

## Norms and Expectations

- Work on our ability to evenly split work up and bring it back together smoothly
- Every sprint results in real things we can demo to the "client"
- Visual diagrams of what we're doing
- Hard time limits (no extra work during lunch, etc)
- Not just sprint requirements, but an open "next task" pile of cards too, for those who finish their sprint duty earlier than everyone else
- Make established time expectation for each sprint
- Define work breakup relative to each sprint's goal
